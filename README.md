# RiddleManor

Riddle Manor is a 3D puzzle-platform video game in which you will have to solve the puzzles found in your grandfather's house. To do this you will have to use the skills of your magic diary.

The game was developed with Unity in 10 weeks by a team of 7 students as a final project of the university year. It was awarded by my university as best game for industry and best art.
